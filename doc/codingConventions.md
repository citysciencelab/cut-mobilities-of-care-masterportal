# Coding conventions

## Introduction

As developer, you're motivated to write your code not only fully functional, but as sustainable as possible. This encompasses a wide range of properties based on the "Clean Code" principles - which will hold true for your code.

To decide as objectively as possible whether your code will pass its pull request, we're using a linter and defined a set of function.

For the linter, we use **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**, with its configuration file **[.eslintrc](../.eslintrc)** included in the repository. On each push, the linter and unit tests will run automatically. Should an error occur, the push is prevented.

Our conventions are divided into two parts. Any violation of a section A convention does result in a pull request declined. Section B covers guidelines. Compliance with those improve the reusability and maintainability of the code. While not mandatory, please consider following these rules, too.

## Conventions

### Section A

All the following rules must hold.

* A.1.6 Backbone: No arrow functions are used in templates.

---

#### A.2 Packages and libraries

* A.2.1 The code uses the frameworks and libraries set by *Geowerkstatt*; they are not bypassed.
* A.2.2 No methods of *Underscore.js* are in use, except for calls to `_.template()`.
* A.2.3 No redundant packages are installed.
* A.2.4 JQuery is only to be used in combination with Backbone.js.

### Section B (optional)

The code is written as readable and understandable as possible. The goal is not to save lines, but the time of future developers working on the code.

#### B.1 Structure

* B.1.1 Markup (templates), styles (CSS), and logic (controller) are written with clean separation of concerns.
* B.1.2 The controller does not produce any HTML.
* B.1.3 The code holds no redundancies. ([No duplicated code / DRY](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%E2%80%99t_repeat_yourself))
* B.1.4 Common functions with global applicability are store in a helper file.
* B.1.5 Each function has *one* well-defined task. ([Curly's Law](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-Responsibility-Prinzip))
* B.1.6 Self-defined functions never change values by reference, but returns the calculated value.
* B.1.7 Templates contain no data-modifying logic or business logic.
* B.1.8 Vue: Persisting data and communicating is done via the VueX Store.

---

#### B.2 Readability and comprehensibility

* B.2.1 The code is written as simple as possible. ([KISS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS-Prinzip))
* B.2.2 Arrow functions are used whenever possible. The `this` context is not dragged along unnecessarily.
* B.2.3 Function parameters and properties have defined default values where applicable.
* B.2.4 Native ECMAScript functions and objects are used.
* B.2.5 Type checks are done with `typeof`, `instanceof`, `Array.isArray()`, and `===`.

---

#### B.3 Vue Best Practice

* B.3.1 Vue components in the `share-components` folder contain comments according to the [Vue Styleguidist](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/).
* B.3.2 Backbone Radio - New Vue modules should avoid using the `Backbone.Radio` where possible. Radio events in old modules can be replaced with VueX store interaction.
* B.3.3 For requests it is recommended to use the library Axios.

---

#### B.4 Vue Best Practice - State management
* B.4.1 For simple getters and mutations the generator functions provided in `./src/app-store/utils/generator.js` are used.
* B.4.2 The VueX helper functions (`mapGetters`, `mapMutations`, ...) are used to integrate store data into components.

---

#### B.5 Vue Best Practice - Style

* B.5.1 Use `scoped` within the style tag whenever possible.
* B.5.2 Avoid usage of the `!important` keyword.
* B.5.3 Avoid setting `width` and `height` to absolute values, as this hinders designing responsively.
* B.5.4 The global less file `variables.less` contains all variables required by *BootstrapV3* and the Masterportal. All theming variables (fonts, colors, ...) are maintained here. The file `variables.less` must only contain variables, mixins, and functions. Adding CSS rules would result in a repetition per import, bloating the CSS size. The `variables.less` is imported to a component's style tag by using the `import` command.

---

#### B.6 Error message output

* B.6.1 Make use of the module *Alerting*.
* B.6.2 Write a speaking error that describes to the user what has gone wrong. Provide the message in multiple languages.
* B.6.3 Only display errors when relevant to the user and the user's current work step.
* B.6.4 When communicating an error to the user, include what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what can be done to resolve the situation. If the user has no option to rectify the situation, reconsider whether the error needs to be communicated at all.
* B.6.5 For technical details use `console.error()` or `console.warn()` and print information in English for your fellow developers.
