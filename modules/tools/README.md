## Description

All tools appearing in the menu "tools" are located in this folder. Entries are maintained in a list. Each list entry has a title, a glyphicon, and an active state (default: `false`). All attributes are optional and controlled in the `config.json` file. The order of tools in the configuration file determines the order of tools in the portal UI.
